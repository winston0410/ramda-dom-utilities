A collection of curried DOM manipulation functions, created with the help of [Ramda](https://ramdajs.com/).

## Features

- All functions in this library return the mutated element, so that you can easily use them in a pipe

- All functions in this library are curried, so that you can easily reuse them

- For API functions that return **undefined**, the **element being used as data** (after mutated by the API) will be returned
